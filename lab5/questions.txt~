CP SC 101: Lab 5, Spring 2015

Using an editor, answer the following questions:

NAME: Andrew Hunter


1) What is the cause of the seg fault in the program called example.c? It would keep running infinitely because the for loop was always true.

2) What line in broken.c did the program seg fault on? Line 28

2) What was the value of the variable "count" at the time of the seg fault? 10

3) What was the value of the variable "i" at the time of the seg fault? 568

4) What was the value of the variable "search" at the time of the seg fault? 1

5) What are the values in the "table" array? 5, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26

6) what do you think the bug is? The while loop needs to have two equal signs. Also to print the correct statement at the end, the while loop needs to be if i>count.
